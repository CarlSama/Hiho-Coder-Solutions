Considering the multiple operations on segment tree, 
	this is all about the creation and manipulation of segment tree.
	(learned for Li.)

After receiving n elem to build segment tree, we can find all the elem would 
	be assigned as leaf node, besides there wouldn't appear a internal node with
	only one child(think about it).
	So, this is an more stronger complate binary tree !
	Array can be used as the relation between node is quit straightforward.

Recurrsion method can be used as the update is from bottom to top.
